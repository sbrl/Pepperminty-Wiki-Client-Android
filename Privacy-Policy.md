# Privacy Policy
Your data is yours. This app will not collect _any_ of your data and send it anywhere else. All it does is interact with the wikis you add to it, and cache some data locally to reduce bandwidth usage. What the wiki owner does with the information you send them is their business.

The following information is sent along with requests to wikis you add to the app:

 - Your IP address
 - The version of [okhttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) (the HTTP client library used by this app) in use
 
The wiki owner may keep server logs containing the URLs you visit, and the information above.

The following information is stored locally on your device:

 - Page lists (in the cache)
 - HTML page content (in the cache)
 - Wiki root URLs (and username and passwords if specified) (in private app storage)
 
If you have rooted your phone, then it is your responsibility to make sure that this app's private data is secure.
