# Changelog
This is the changelog for the Pepperminty Wiki Android Client. This is the master list of things that have changed (second only to the commit history!) - though the information for any particular release can also be found in the description of it's page for every release made on GitHub too.

## v0.3-dev

## v0.2

### Added
 - Added swipe-down gesture to main page list that re-fetches the page list from the internet
 - Added new 3-dots menu to main page list with option to refresh

### Fixed
 - Tidied up the connection tester when adding a wiki. It's more helpful, has new icons, and disables the "Add Wiki" button when there's an error! :D

## v0.1 (internal)
 - Initial release!
 - It's a wonder I managed to remember to start a changelog this early.... the Google Play Store Dashboard probably had a hand in that :P
