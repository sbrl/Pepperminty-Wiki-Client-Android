# Changelog
This is the changelog for the Pepperminty Wiki Android Client. This is the master list of things that have changed (second only to the commit history!) - though the information for any particular release can also be found in the description of it's page for every release made on GitHub too.


## v2.2
 - Update dependencies
 - Make `MemoryCookieJar` a singleton to reduce excess login attempts


## v2.1
 - Add the full-text search function! :D


## v2.0
 - Completely rewrite! It's much better written now.... and there are a number of extra features coming soon that you can see in the bottom navigation bar!
 - Unfortunately devices on Android 8.0 and below won't be able to update to the new version :-/
	 - As far as I can tell I can keep the old version in the release so that older devices can still download it though


## v0.3-dev
 - Bugfix: Don't say that the page list / recent changes lists have been refresh when they haven't
 - Fix colours on Android 9 Pie dark mode thingy (todo: implement a dark theme, but this is a step towards it)
 - Extensive refactoring to aid maintainability (let me know if there are any bugs)

## v0.2

### Added
 - Added swipe-down gesture to main page list that re-fetches the page list from the internet
 - Added new 3-dots menu to main page list with option to refresh

### Fixed
 - Tidied up the connection tester when adding a wiki. It's more helpful, has new icons, and disables the "Add Wiki" button when there's an error! :D

## v0.1 (internal)
 - Initial release!
 - It's a wonder I managed to remember to start a changelog this early.... the Google Play Store Dashboard probably had a hand in that :P
